# Accessibility_n_Optimization

## Sample website to demonstrate how refactoring can improve Accessibility and Optimization for search engines. 

The aim of this project was to create a concise and straight forward demo website applying HTML standards and CSS styling. 

In there, it can be seen HTML semantic standards and hierarchy structure as baseline.

Then, a linked .CSS file, was used to add more stylish and responsive appearance to the website. It was done with the intention of improving the readability and accessibility to the content. Making it more attractive and convincing for the end user. 

From the technical point of view, a few strategies to make the code easy to understand and maintain were applied. Clear and organised comments were place explaining the intention and logic of the commands implemented along the CSS and HTML files. There was also several variables and elements implemented to reduce the length of the code and avoid repetitive functions.
